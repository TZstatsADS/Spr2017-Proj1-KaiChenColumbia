Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Do Presidents Speak For Their Party?
+ This project is conducted by [Kai Chen]

+ Project summary: This project used text mining tools to answer three questions and analyze the change in emotions between before and after being a president. The three questions are as follows: 
  1. In aspect of topics or focus, what is the significant point between the nominee and the party? 
  2. Who, among presidents in U.S.A., keeps the exactly same pace with his party? Who can be considered to ignore the party's announcement when he gave his inagual speech?
  3. How about other speeches given by the precidents, like farewells and nominees' speeches?
